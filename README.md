1. Starting the server
The program starts a server that runs on your computer. This server waits for a request with data to be analyzed. The server runs at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ — this is like a "home address" for the program.

2. Receiving data
When you send a request to the server, the program receives the business data you provided. This data includes:
• Financial indicators: such as revenue, profit, debt.
• Qualitative indicators: such as the company's reputation, management experience.
• Number of qubits: this is a parameter that determines how many "quantum bits" (qubits) will be used for analysis.

3. Checking data
The program checks that the amount of input data (financial and qualitative indicators) does not exceed the number of qubits. If there is too much data, the program reports an error and terminates.

4. Normalizing data
The program brings all data to the same scale. This is necessary so that financial indicators (for example, millions of rubles) and qualitative indicators (for example, ratings from 0 to 1) can be correctly compared and analyzed.

5. Classic analysis
The program uses classical machine learning methods (in this case, the Random Forest algorithm) to analyze data. This algorithm is similar to a "decision tree" that makes a decision based on the provided data. For example:
• If revenue is high and debts are low, then the business is assessed as "good."
• If revenue is low and debts are high, then the business is assessed as "bad."

6. Quantum analysis
The program uses quantum computing for more complex analysis. Here's how it works:
• Qubits: These are "quantum bits" that can be in the state of 0, 1, or both at the same time (this is called superposition). This allows for more flexible data analysis.
• Quantum circuit: The program creates a special circuit that uses qubits to analyze data. This circuit is like a "recipe" that tells how to process the data.
• Model training: the program adjusts the parameters of the quantum circuit so that it analyzes the data better. This is similar to how you tune a radio to catch the right wave.

7. Combining results
The program combines the results of classical and quantum analysis. For example:
• Classical analysis says: "The state of the business is good."
• Quantum analysis says: "The state of the business is average."
• The program averages these results and makes a final decision.

8. Assessing the state of the business
Based on the combined result, the program assesses the state of the business:
• Good: if the result is greater than or equal to 0.7.
• Average: if the result is between 0.4 and 0.7.
• Bad: if the result is less than 0.4.

9. Returning the result
The program sends you a response that includes:
• The state of the business: "Good", "Average" or "Bad".
• Classical analysis result: a number (e.g. 1 - good, 0 - bad).
• Result of quantum analysis: a number (e.g. 0.85 is close to good).
• Final score: the average between classical and quantum analysis.

Example of program operation
Input data:
json
Copy
{
"financial_data": [1000000, 500000, 200000],
"qualitative_data": [0.8, 0.9, 0.7],
"num_qubits": 6
}
Response of the program:
json
Copy
{
"financial_status": "Good",
"classical_prediction": 1,
"quantum_prediction": 0.85,
"final_score": 0.925
}
What does this mean:
• Classical analysis assessed the state of the business as "good" (1).
• Quantum analysis assessed the state of the business as close to "good" (0.85).
• The final score (0.925) indicates that the business is in "Good" condition.

Why is this useful?
1. Classical analysis helps you quickly assess the business condition based on known data.
2. Quantum analysis adds a deeper and more flexible approach that can take into account complex relationships between data.
3. The combined result provides a more accurate assessment than either method alone.

An analogy for understanding
Imagine that you want to assess how good a restaurant is. You can:
1. Ask your friends (classical analysis) - they will give you their opinion.
2. Use online reviews (quantum analysis) - this will give you more detailed information.
3. Combine both opinions - to get a more accurate result.

Conclusion
The program combines classical and quantum methods to assess the condition of a business. This allows you to get a more accurate and reliable result than using only one of the methods.
